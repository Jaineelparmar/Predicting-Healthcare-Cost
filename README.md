• Analyzed Correlations and Median: Evaluated the correlation between different variables and calculated the median healthcare cost to understand data distribution and central tendency.

• Conducted Mean Cost Analysis: Performed mean cost analysis across several categorical variables like sex, smoker status, region, age, BMI, and number of children to identify patterns in healthcare expenses.

• Trained and Evaluated a Model: Utilized an Extra Trees Regressor model, transforming categorical data into numerical, and assessed the model's performance by predicting training and test sets. The evaluation metrics included Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and feature importance ranking to determine the model's accuracy and the significance of each variable in predicting healthcare costs.
